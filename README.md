# SVGD
This repository contains all the simulations and results that I have found during my research project at Télécom Paris when tackling the topic of Stein Variational Gradient Descent. Here is the link to the [final report](https://elfirdoussilab1.github.io/files/SVGD_Final_report.pdf) that simmarizes my work, as well as a [state-of-the-art](https://elfirdoussilab1.github.io/files/SVGD_State_of_the_Art.pdf) article that presents existing methods in 2023.
